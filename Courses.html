    <h3>Comprehensive 2027-JEE/CET course for students entering 11th std</h3>
    To succeed in prominent engineering entrance exams, one requires a thorough understanding of subjects: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and the ability to solve unseen and new questions with accuracy and speed. Comprehensive course is designed in such a way that a sincere student is bound to cultivate self-confidence and acquire a grip and easy feel for all engineering entrance exams.
<h3>Summer Foundation Course (for students entering 11th standard)</h3>
The Summer Foundation course is of 21 days duration.
The course is designed for those students who've not done any Foundation course and are going to join 2 year Comprehensive Course. This course helps students start the preparation process early and the vacation time is also utilized fruitfully. It also helps Students feel charged up and confident for their JEE preparation journey ahead. 
<h3>Pre Foundation Basic (for students entering 6th/7th standard)</h3>
7.5 Months course for students currently in 5th/6th and moving to 6th/7th standard)
In this fast-paced world, the ability to analyse things in depth is badly missing, but is a cornerstone for excellence in most fields. This can be best developed, in relatively early years, through Math basics, thought-provoking logic-based exercises and age appropriate riddles.
We at BT believe that most students are geniuses but under nurtured by the information based instead of the thinking-based education. And when students realize that the formal education system has left them with unclear concepts and mediocre thinking, it usually is late.
Hence, the  Pre Foundation course at BT is a novel concept thoughtfully designed to work on students analytical thinking and problem solving abilities at an early stage. Here students will be having fun with Math and Logic, learning it from very high quality teachers. 
<h3>Foundation Basic (for students entering 8th/9th standard)
</h3>
(9 Months course for students currently in 7th/8th and moving to 8th/9th standard) 
The Foundation course at BT is thoughtfully designed to help students crack quality competitive exams. The Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics lectures and the corresponding assignment sheets are carefully planned to help early generation of interests in these subjects. The Logic lectures further facilitate in developing the students analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. The Coding lectures will also ensure that students understand the basic concepts of coding at this early age itself, thereby giving them a competitive edge. We have also added Biology subject in the Foundation course as an additional option (details of the same is mentioned ahead in this leaflet).
